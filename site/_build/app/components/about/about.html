		<p>My name is Tanner Woodworth and I am a front-end web developer based in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>

		<p>I have attended school at Pittsburgh Technical College where I received my Associate in Science Degree in Multimedia Technologies with a concentration in Web Design and Development. While attending school at PTC, I had received numerous awards for academic achievements as well as a Best in Show award for the Spring 2016 Portfolio show, and a 1st place Graphic Design Scholarship award.</p>

		<p>Over the years I have had the opprotunity to work with a multitude of different clients. Aside from web work, I have also assisted numerous clients with video and photography projects.</p>

	<p>I try and squeeze as much learning into a day as I can, whether that means working through some online courses in my spare time, listening to an audiobook on my way to get groceries, or a podcast while learning.</p>

		<p>I do my best to select hobbies analogous to my career, such as podcasting, photography, and even a little game development.</p>
